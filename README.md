# Font Test Card

A quick and dirty way to test out and compare different Google fonts. Unlike the Google fonts website it gives you a preview of what the font looks like in bold, caps and italic along with the regular text.

The list of fonts included is a curated list of some of my favourite Google Fonts but it can be changed by editing the scripts.js file.

Long term plan is to add options for changing the color and size of the font on the fly.
